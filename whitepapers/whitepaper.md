# 3	ARKeth Token & Platform Project Summery
## 3.1	Overview of the ARKeth Token & Platform Project
The ARKeth Project name came into existence from the inspiration of a great sci-fi hero character in The
Steel Remains book written by Richard K. Morgan. In addition, we click on web ads and must watch
video ads on large social platforms and we're not getting anything in return for it. Software Architect
and Artist Jose F. Sosa designed the platform that will be the premier social ad platform that pays users
for clicking on ads as well as paying the hosting companies for the ad space.
The platform will use Blockchain, AI and Cryptocurrency to place ads on social platforms and pay
participants a small amount of token in ARKeth cryptocurrency for participating in clicking the ads or
watching the ads in videos and trading the ARK tokens for value.
The main differentiators of the ARKeth platform is it pays the community of users back for enduring
video ads and ads in social platforms. ARKeth also creates a new gaming platform on the Ethereum rales
to turn advertising campaigns into feverish social click games allowing advertises to make random or
selecting the Nth user clicking on the ad for higher payouts.
The AI system along with the blockchain tracks the click usage data anonymously to predict ad trends for
the advertisers
In addition, future markets that can become available include video platform such as Netflicks and Hulu.
Radio and analog markets can also be part of this trend when the technology becomes available.

be initiated by another user.

User validity. Details: an Ethereum address with positive token balance may not correspond to any
actual user or a private key, as it can be a result of a mistake. Tokens transferred to such users will likely
be lost.

to it by users who are not contract owners.
Complete registry. Details: The contract does not provide a list of all token holders. Such a list can be
obtained by exploring the contract storage using Blockchain Explorers.

# 17 Risk Factors
Risk Factors
<pre>
1.	The purchase of tokens involves a high degree of risk: including but not limited to the risks
described below. Before acquiring ARK tokens on the ARKeth platform, it is recommended that
each participant carefully weighs all the information and risks detailed in the White Paper, and,
specifically, the following risk factors.
2.	Loss or destruction of the private key: Cryptocurrencies are stored in a digital wallet and are
controllable only by the possessor of both the public key and the private key relating to the
digital wallet in which the bitcoins are held, both of which are unique.
3.	Other cyber-security risks including malicious activity: Trading platforms and third-party service
providers may be vulnerable to hacking or other malicious activities.
4.	Risks associated with peer-to-peer transactions: Digital currencies can be traded on numerous
online platforms, through third party service providers and as peer-to-peer transactions
between parties.
5.	Other risks related to trading platforms and exchanges: Digital currency trading platforms,
largely unregulated and providing only limited transparency with respect to their operations,
have come under increasing scrutiny due to cases of fraud, business failure or security breaches,
where investors could not be compensated for losses suffered.
6.	Loss of confidence in digital currencies: Digital currencies are part of a new and rapidly evolving
"digital assets industry", which itself is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
7.	Regulations preventing or restricting trading of digital currencies: There are significant
inconsistencies among various regulators with respect to the legal status of digital currencies.
